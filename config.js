        "You revealed the strength I hold inside, and how to wield it without pride. You helped me see who I truly am, the person I was meant to be all along.",
        "You taught me to believe, to reach, to dream, to embrace the goals I can achieve. For this love, I'm endlessly grateful - a love that feels like a gift from above.",
        "You've given me a piece of who you are, keeping me grounded, never far. You are everything. More than words can hold. My love for you runs deeper than any fight we‚Äôve had or any silence between us.",
        "You‚Äôre the fire that shapes me, the reason I keep pushing when everything else feels heavy. Our relationship isn‚Äôt easy‚Äîsometimes it breaks me down, sometimes it builds me up. But through it all, you remain the center of my world.",

        "You never failed to make me smile. Things aren't getting better ever since we fought, I just miss you so much. Having random breakdowns, with you on my mind wondering if you're doing fine. I'm sorry I wasn't what you wanted.",
        "I'm sorry I wasn't the best, I'm sorry I couldn't be good enough for you. I just hope everything will be okay soon, I really miss how we used to talk. ü•π"
